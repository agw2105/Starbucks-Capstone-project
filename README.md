# Starbucks-Capstone-project
Capstone project for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer nanodegree


## OVERVIEW

Starbucks is a global coffee chain with millions of customers worldwide. The diversity of these customers is reflected not just in their demographics, location, and coffee preferences, but in how they respond to promotions and advertisements. The Starbucks app is a platform to reach the broadest possible customer base and entice them to choose Starbucks as their caffeinator of choice. This is achieved through seamless online ordering, customer service, and special offers. Special offers, such as discounts, BOGO, and bonus points, can boost sales by encouraging a user to purchase a product that they otherwise might not have.
